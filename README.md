# Reading notes on articles in 3D CV
## Author: Dzhavid Sadreddinov
This repository contains summaries and keypoints of articles, which I have read in learning 3D computer vision. 
The documents are grouped by task, the article is solving, if the articles allows to solve multiple problems it was added to the task, where I met the article.
